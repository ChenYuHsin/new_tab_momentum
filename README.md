# New_tab for Breach browser
This repository contains an new tab module for Breach browser. It's based on the momentum plugin for Google Chrome: [Momentum Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca)

At this moment it only creates an welcome page with your name and a main focus for today. More features are coming soon.
